Kernel
======

All of the code here (sans the Makefile) has come from [JamesM's kernel development tutorial](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html). My only contribution is providing more verbose comments to his code I found from external resources. Those external resources consist primarily of [Bran's Kernel Development tutorial](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm) and the [OSDev Wiki](wiki.osdev.org).
