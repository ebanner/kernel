Kernel
======

Virtually all of the code here has come from [JamesM's kernel development tutorial](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html). 

My only contributions are the Makefile and providing more verbose comments. Other resources I used include [Bran's Kernel Development tutorial](http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm) and the [OSDev Wiki](wiki.osdev.org).
