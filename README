Most of this code has come from Bran's Kernel Development tutorial.  You can
find this tutorial at http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/title.htm.

Another resouce I have heavily relied on is Eric Hutchin's ``Writing a Kernel
From Scratch with Free Software".  This book can be downloaded at
http://cs.potsdam.edu/CS/files/Capstone/2010/hutchins.pdf.
